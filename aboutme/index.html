<p>I have always been aware of how food is advertised and promoted, that specific colours evoke different emotions and how companies use that to their advantage in their designs. However, it wasn’t until I had done some extensive research that I truly realised how beneficial a good design can be for a business. I have honed down my research and, in this article, have chosen to expose fast food and the true reason behind their success across the world. I am passionate about this subject as I think it is important that young people should be encouraged to eat healthier and I always wondered how fast-food restaurants became so popular. By deeply analysing the way in which places like McDonald’s or KFC use typography and design to reel their customers, it has come clear to me that colours, shapes and fonts have a psychological effect on people, especially children. Eating at fast food restaurants is easy and it is cheap, but why do we continue to promote food that has proven to be detrimental to people’s health and been a huge factor to the increase of child obesity.

  <p>I joined Oxford Brookes University in September 2020, in the height of COVID. In this year I struggled to maintain any sort of healthy lifestyle and slipped into many bad habits. At the end of the year, I reflected on how much fast food I had consumed and it made me realise how I didn’t want my eating habits to ever get that bad ever again. This year I have focussed on bettering my eating, which has made question why unhealthy foods are promoted more than healthy foods in British advertisement. I hope that my article will create a sense of awareness for this, so people aren't lured in and so won't make the same mistakes as I did.
