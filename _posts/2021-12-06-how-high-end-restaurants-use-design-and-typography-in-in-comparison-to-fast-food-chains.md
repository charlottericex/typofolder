The designs of majority of fast-food chains around the world aim to appeal to the masses and they do that using clever techniques to lure in all audiences. However expensive, high-end restaurants use different techniques as they are aiming to attract a certain type of customer. High-end restaurants want to appeal to people who are rich and although they attract less people than fast-food chains would, the people they entice are willing to pay expensive prices for quality food. So, what kind of designs attract wealthy customers?

After analysing The Ivy and The Ritz’s websites it has become apparent that they use similar design methods by creating a stylish layout to present their classy and sophisticated chain of restaurant. The Ivy’s logo is very simplistic, it is literally ‘The Ivy’ written in capitals, in dark green. The font has a regular weight, a fairly high contrast and is slightly extended in width. I think it is predominantly the dark green that enforces a chic and inviting tone to the website, which compliments the simplicity of the font. The Ritz’s logo is an illustration of a lion holding a *globus cruciger*, which is Latin for a “cross-bearing orb” and a Christian symbol of authority. It also includes a banner underneath which has ‘Ritz’ written on it in white and in capital letters. I think this logo provides connotations of royalty as the symbol of the lion presents the restaurant as majestic and proud. The main colour used in the typography of The Ritz website is a dark blue which continues to highlight the prestigious tone that the Ritz is aiming to create. Both websites show us an insight into what wealthy, upper class people look for when choosing a restaurant, both websites also include a lot of photography, showing their target market their fancy locations and intricate food.

The designs and typography used in The Ivy and The Ritz’s websites compared with the bright, extravagant designs of both McDonald’s and KFC’s websites, really pinpoints the contrasting aims of these restaurant chains. I think that it makes the fast-food chains designs in general seem tacky and cheap, even though it has helped them gain popularity. High-end restaurants should aim to use similar design and typography techniques to both The Ivy and The Ritz, I think they both succeed in their aims to attract a selective audience and display the sophisticated and classy experience that their restaurants provide.
