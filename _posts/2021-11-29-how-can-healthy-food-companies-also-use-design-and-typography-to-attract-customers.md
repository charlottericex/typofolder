Fast food is extremely popular, its cheap, accessible, tasty, satisfying and advertised EVERYWHERE. The typography and design that is used in all fast-food advertisement is bright, bold, and eye-catching, but this can be seen as quite manipulative to younger audiences as it promotes unhealthy eating. If these design techniques were adopted by restaurants that specialise in making healthy foods, would it persuade more people to change their lifestyle choices?

After analysing many healthy food chains use of design and typography, it has become apparent that the colour green provides connotations of health. An example of a food chain that evokes healthy eating is the sushi place Wasabi. By analysing their use of typography and colour in comparison with McDonald’s, it is clear their intention is to create a more sophisticated and mature aesthetic. The bright yellows and reds that McDonald’s use in their design conveys more childish connotations therefore indicating that their target is younger audiences. Wasabi has a colour scheme of predominantly dark greens, light greens, and light oranges which we associate with health and abundance, as those colours are commonly the colours of fruits and vegetables. Wasabi continues to create a sophisticated aesthetic using a font that is light in weight, with a low contrast and fairly condensed in width. The letters are also all lower case on the Wasabi website and logo, this is a notable difference to McDonald’s use of mainly capital letters which suggests that both companies have contrasting intentions. I think that Wasabi’s main aim is to attract people who try to eat healthily, I think the design they use is a lot more prestigious in comparison to the typography McDonald’s uses, as they want to come across as authentic and trustworthy.

Most healthy restaurant chains have similar design ideas to Wasabi, with the clear intention to provide connotations of health through design and typography. Although they are achieving their goal of creating a pure, sophisticated aesthetic, in terms of popularity fast food is more successful. It is important that healthy eating is promoted to younger audiences, if these restaurants could adopt similar techniques that fast food chains use in their design like using more eye-catching, bold typography. By doing this and maintaining the main essence of the company, I think it would help promote healthier eating among young people.
