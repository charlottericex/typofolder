Have you found yourself in a vicious cycle of buying takeaways and eating unhealthy food? Well this magazine might help you realise why you feel these urges to purchase fast food and exploit how manipulative the design and typography used in modern day fast food restaurants can be. 

In these articles, it analyses the use of design and typography from places such as McDonald's to places like The Ritz. My aim was to explore how design techniques differ depending on a companies target market and general goals for their business. I decided to hone in on fast food, because I think their use of design can have a negative impact on people's health as fast food restaurants are designed to lure people in even to the point were they use psychological techniques to influence the public. 

I am hoping these articles will exploit the truth and help people see beyond the design so they can make healthier choices.
