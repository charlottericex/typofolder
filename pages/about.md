My aim for my website is to highlight how fast food restaurants use typography, colour scheme and design to promote their food. I have also explored how the this can be somewhat very manipulative, especially for younger audiences. To expand upon this I want to compare how healthy food is presented through design and how we can change how unhealthy food is advertised.
